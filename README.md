# Auto-Vinted

Auto-Vinted is a Python tool to automate reposting on Vinted using the (undocumented) Vinted API. Initially it was designed to save me hours of effort by reuploading existing items.  I'm not a professional seller but even a private seller with a moderate wardrobe has to spend way too long to reupload items.  This is a feature that Vinted should provide themselves but since they do not I needed to step in or stop being a seller on their platform. I eventually aim to expand it into a full listing creation and management tool, unless Vinted starts offering this themselves.

## Current Features
- Repost existing items
- Save your photos

## Future Features
 - Save info about each item in the wardrobe.
 - Other things priorited based on my own needs as a private Vinted Seller
 - Other things depending on how I evolve this for end-users or 3rd parties (app, extension, or website makers)

## Pricing
Since Vinted's API is not documented this took me a huge amount of time to work out. I'm looking for fair compensation for this effort.  Since end-users are less likely to be visiting github the main interest is from app, extension, or website makers that will charge a monthly subscription fee for their customers.  I've no problem with that, and wish them well, but if this code helps you on that journey and saves you a ton of time then my price is worth it.  If not, then I wish you good luck, and perhaps one day I'll also become a customer of your product/service.

I'm currently updating my license and terms of use which will be available shortly.  Meanwhile if you are interested then let's start a chat.  Send me an email at the address on my GitHub Bio.

- Developer edition: a one-off purchase for 100 euros. This comes with Python code and basic instructions. You save yourself hours of figuring the API calls and jumpstart your own project.  The day you will get the code it will be working, or you get your money back.  If Vinted changes their API in the first week (that would be really bad luck but it will happen to someone, at some point, in some future) then I'll help to try and get it working again, or offer a 50% discount.  If you want a stable API then provide services to Professional Vinted sellers as Vinted provides public API documentation for Vinted Pro.  This price also discourages less serious developers that could misuse the code and encourage Vinted to make life harder for the rest of us. 

- Consumer/Business edition: reposting items on your behalf. If you are time poor then for 5 euros I will repost up to 15 items for you.  For more than 15 items contact me to discuss a custom rate.  If you think this is expensive then time yourself reposting 15 items with just a few photos.  If you a) complete the exercise without wanting to give up and b) look forward to doing it again in a couple of weeks then you're right, it is too expensive for you.  And that's ok but I couldn't face doing that regularly myself, hence why I built this tool.
