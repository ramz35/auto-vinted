# Auto-Vinted

Auto-Vinted is a Python tool to automate uploading, reposting, and creating listings on Vinted using the Vinted API.

Initially designed to save you hours of effort by reupload existing items, it is being built to expand into a full listing creation and management tool.

## Features

- Repost any existing item
- Repost items that are older than 1 or more months
- Create listings from scratch
- Save your listing details and their photos 

Since Vinted's API is not documneted this took me a while to work out. If you are interested in any of the following then send me a message Git Hub.
- Dev/Techie edition: a one-off purchase for 30 euros. This comes with the code and basic instructions. You can run it or save yourself hours of figuring the API calls and jumpstart your own project. You get 3 months of support in case Vinted changes their API.
-- extra 3 months of support for 5 euros
- Business edition: reposting items on your behalf. If you are time poor then for 5 euros I will repost up to 10 items for you.
-- For more than 10 items contact me for discounted rates. 
- Consumer edition: 50 euros. For this I will give you the code and show you how you install and run it.
